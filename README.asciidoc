Vim-Kweasy
----------

__Makes you kweasy, or your money back!__

Vim-KWEasy lets you jump to the very character you've got your eyeballs on!
Just look at the screen and take a note of the character you want to land on
and then press <leader>k followed by that character!

Dependencies

Vim-KWEasy depends on https://github.com/dahu/Nexus[Nexus]

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `<tabs>` cause offset errors

* The display chars are limited in size and get re-used if the search char
  appears more times than this size limit. The jump will land on the first
  occuurrence on screen of the chosen character.
