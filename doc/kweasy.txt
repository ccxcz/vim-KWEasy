Vim-KWEasy lets you jump to the very character you've got your eyeballs on!
Just look at the screen and take a note of the character you want to land on
and then press <leader>k followed by that character!

You can change the default map (<leader>k) with a line like this in your ~/.vimrc:
>
  nmap <leader>q <Plug>KweasyJump
<
